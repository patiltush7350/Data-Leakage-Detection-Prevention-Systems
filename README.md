# ðŸš€ Data Leakage Detection and Prevention System

## Project Overview
The aim of this project is to develop a system that can detect and prevent data leakage. The system will monitor data transfers, analyze patterns, and alert administrators of potential data leaks. It will also include a data visualization component to present security metrics and incidents.

## Key Features
- **User Authentication and Authorization:** Secure login and role-based access control.
- **Data Monitoring:** Track data transfer activities across the network.
- **Leakage Detection:** Implement algorithms to detect unusual data access patterns.
- **Alert System:** Notify administrators of potential data leaks.
- **Data Visualization:** Dashboard to visualize security metrics, incidents, and trends.

## Technology Stack
- **Backend:** Java, Spring Boot
- **Database:** MySQL
- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript (with D3.js or Chart.js for visualization)
- **Additional Libraries:** Spring Security, Hibernate

## Implementation Steps
1. **Setup Spring Boot Project**
    - Initialize a Spring Boot project using Spring Initializr or your preferred method.
    - Include dependencies for Spring Web, Spring Security, Spring Data JPA, and MySQL.
2. **Configure MySQL Database**
    - Set up a MySQL database and configure the connection in `application.properties`.
3. **User Authentication and Authorization**
    - Implement user registration and login with Spring Security.
    - Define roles such as ADMIN and USER and restrict access to certain endpoints based on roles.
4. **Data Monitoring Module**
    - Create entities to represent data transfer logs.
    - Develop a service to log every data transfer activity, capturing details like user ID, data accessed, timestamp, and action type.
5. **Leakage Detection Algorithms**
    - Implement basic anomaly detection algorithms. For example, flag access patterns that deviate significantly from the user's typical behavior.
    - Use statistical methods or machine learning techniques to enhance detection accuracy.
6. **Alert System**
    - Create a notification service that triggers alerts (via email, SMS, or in-app notifications) when a potential data leak is detected.
    - Ensure the alert system integrates seamlessly with the monitoring module.
7. **Data Visualization Dashboard**
    - Set up a frontend using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
    - Use a JavaScript library like D3.js or Chart.js to create interactive charts and graphs.
    - Visualize key metrics such as the number of data access attempts, detected anomalies, and response times.

## Usage
- **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your_username/data-leakage-detection.git


## Usage

After setting up the DLP system, you can utilize the dashboard to monitor data transfers, view logs, receive alerts about potential data leaks, and manage settings. Interaction with the system can be done via HTTP requests to the appropriate endpoints exposed by each service.

## Example Endpoints

- **Logs**: `GET /logs`
- **Alerts**: `GET /alerts`
- **Settings**: `GET /settings`
- **Dashboard**: `GET /home`
